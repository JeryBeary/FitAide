  This is a group project made by the following Bronx High School of Science students at the first annual hackathon at our high school.
  It its by no means a great application, but we are proud of what we have accomplished and learned in less than eight hours.
  The application has numerous functionalities including a pedometer, a fitness and diet tracker, and a bicep curl recorder that is linked
  to the MYO armband. The coolest features that were implemented were good photoshops (an actual logo and nice buttons), internet and email connections,
  and notifications that would give the user feedback on the quality of his/her bicep curls.
